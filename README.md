Pilots that kept us safely on transect and got us back down on the ground included Simon Garland, Steve Ewen and Gail Nolan flying for Shine Aviation Services. Kym Reeve successfully coordinated all three aerial surveys and ensured the high quality of the data collected in the field. Sincere thanks to the observers Christophe Cleguer, Daniella Hanf, Jane Kennedy, Krista Nicholson, Margie Rule, Chandra Salgado-Kent, Jenny Smith, Julian Tyne, Kristel Wenziker and Erin Wyatt. This research was funded by the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG Projectâ€™s State Environmental Offsets Program and administered by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. The Wheatstone Project is a joint venture between Australian subsidiaries of Chevron, Kuwaut Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC), Apache Corporation and Kyushu Electric Power Company, together with PE Wheatstone Pty Ltd (part-owned by TEPCO). This project was also supported by Woodside through the Pluto LNG Environmental Offsets Program.
